## Retention of Records
Where no suspected criminal or evidence gathering has been requested by an authority or no incident related to criminal activity has occured on the premises, recordings will be deleted automatically on a rolling 30 days.  Where there is a requirement to retain data for a criminal investigation, these will be stored in an encrypted format securely away from the camera.

## Signage

### Access Control
Recordings are only accessible via the mobile app, which requires access to the WPA3 encrypted local wireless network.  The device itself is fingerprint locked to the sole user.

## Your Rights

Depending on whether the footage is available, this will either be provided if requested or confirmation of deletion will be forthcoming dependent on request. Deletion requests may be refused if there is an ongoing legal or criminal investigation and if the footage is required for this purpose.
